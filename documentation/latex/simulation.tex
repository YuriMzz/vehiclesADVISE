\chapter{Simulation}\label{ch:simulation}
\section{General Results}
We decide to simulate 200 units of time (200h) with Mobius in order to evaluate each attacker results for 
different configuration of mitigations. We obtain those general results:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item the \textbf{Hacker} will always try to achieve the most remunerative goals, despite the
        possibility to be discovered; 
    \item the \textbf{Physical intruder} will try to achieve only the most remunerative goal, and will
        ignore others because of the high probability of being discovered (risk-reward ratio is too low)
    \item the \textbf{Insider} has the same behaviour of the Physical intruder, but for him the probability
        to reach the goal increases faster because his attack path has higher success probability.
\end{itemize}
\newpage
\section{Hacker Attacks}
\subsection*{DoS}
When no mitigation are applied, the Hacker will rarely try to obtain a DoS, but he will commit himself
on other attacks in order to obtain high reward goals. Introducing \textbf{CodeObfuscation}, binary reversing
become harder to complete with success, leading to a probability of reach DoS near to 0.\\
Increasing the firewall sensitivity will indeed increase the probability for the hacker to reach the DoS,
because he will give up on trying to reach other goals, focusing only on this one.

\subsection*{Data Breach and Vehicle Undesidered Behaviour}
When no mitigation are applied, the Hacker will reach those goals pretty fast. Introducing \textbf{CodeObfuscation}
will slow him down, but increasing \textbf{Firewall Sensitivity} we are able to reduce his will to reach them
until he will give up.

\section{Physical Intruder and Insider Attacks}

\subsection*{Vehicle Undesidered Behaviour}
When no mitigation are applied, both attackers will reach this goal pretty fast. Increasing 
\textbf{Intrusion Detection System Sensitivity}, we are able to reduce their will to reach the goal
until they will give up, because the probaility to be discovered will be to high.
