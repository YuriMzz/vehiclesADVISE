\chapter{Overview}\label{ch:overview}

In this chapter a general overview of the scenarios and the involved actors is given.

\section{Actors} %TODO change to adversaries?
\noindent In our model we have three different types of actors:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Hacker
	
	\noindent (S)he is a malicious person with an in-depth knowledge of the most important and widespread technologies and attacks. For this reasons he is the most skilled user.
	
	\item Insider
	
	\noindent (S)he is a person who is inside the organization and so he has more accesses w.r.t. an outsider attacker and in particular he has a lot of knowledges, on the other side he has not the same skill level of the hacker.
	
	\item Physical Intruder
	
	\noindent (S)he is a person who is able to have physical access to the infrastructures under analysis. The physical intruder can be an insider with particular privileges (e.g. access to the server room) or also an hacker who was able to retrieve in a malicious way the physical access to the infrastructures.
\end{itemize}


\noindent TODO: mettere una tabella con le skill, le conoscenze e gli accessi a disposizione di ogni attaccante
